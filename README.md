# Gram-Schmidt Algorithm Calculator
Python software that calculates an orthogonal vector set based on a variable-sized input set using the Gram-Schmidt Algorithm.<br>
This version includes two Python files: one that requires you to manually call the function to calculate the vector set (gram-schimdt.py), and another one featuring a more refined input/output interface.
